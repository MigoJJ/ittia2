9In this code, the File class is used to represent the directory and the file to be deleted. The file is deleted using the delete() method, which returns a boolean value indicating whether the deletion was successful or not. If the deletion was successful, the code prints "File deleted successfully." to the console. Otherwise, it prints "File deletion failed.".

Note that the code assumes that the file to be deleted is located in the specified directory, and that the Java application has permission to delete files in that directory.
